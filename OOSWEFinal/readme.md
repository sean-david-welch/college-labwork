-   N.B: There are two versions of the class implementation in the project

1. Can be found within the src directory (./src/\*). This is the version of the application built for easy compilation and running within the console based off the commands provided within the Makefile
    - to run the application simply run make deply in the terminal and this will build and start the applcation. Follow the instructions for further information
2. The second version was built in order to facilitate the use of the Junit testing framework
    - To do this, Maven was needed as a dependancy manager and thus, the application was build as a Maven project with IntelliJ Idea,
    - the Code for this application can be found within the ecommerce directory and the project structure follows that of a typical maven project form there
    - In essence, in order to run the application and tests from the project, it will need to be done with within IntelliJ

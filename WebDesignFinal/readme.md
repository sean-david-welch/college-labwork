## References

-   Some ideas for styles came from my previous projects aswell as online resources:
-   For example, the idea for the typewriter came from a previous project and was refactored to use jquery: https://github.com/sean-david-welch/Farmec-v1/blob/main/development/static/js/typewriter.js
-   As too was the carousel, but a different implementation was used: https://github.com/sean-david-welch/Farmec-v1/blob/main/development/static/js/carousel.js
-   AI tools were used to generate random content about the web application such as in the about section aswell as formatting data about cars into json and markdown
-   Car Images were taken from the royalty free website pexels at: https://www.pexels.com/search/car/
-   The references to those styles (translated from tailwind css -> conventional css in this project) can be found here: https://github.com/sean-david-welch/farmec-v2/tree/main/client/src/styles
-   used this website to reference hex codes for colors: https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/88213
-   used photopea and mac preview to change some images: https://www.photopea.com/
-   figma was used to create wireframe documents: https://www.figma.com/file/P7GQdiLBzmzh3bXWCRa6hV/Final-Wireframe?type=design&node-id=12-405&mode=design&t=Wqbj4U2ilw2QczHa-0
-   mozilla documentation was consulted for certain javascript implementations: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

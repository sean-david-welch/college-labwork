// Question 2
// Alter the guessing game application so that every time it plays the user is asked do they want to play again.
// Depending on what the user enters the application should keep going until they wish to stop.

// Bonus: store the user guesses and return them to the user when they finish or win.
// Note this may necessitate the creation of a large blank array
